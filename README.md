### Minionize

This project provides some time to focus more on ourselves to be the Minion that we define. No restriction or limitation to being my Minion and there is no specific definition of Minion either.

I want to convey the message ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter‚Äù through my childhood experience back in South Korea. (Refer to the images below!)
